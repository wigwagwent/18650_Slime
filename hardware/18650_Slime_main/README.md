# 18650 SlimeVR
This PCB is designed to be about the same size as a 18650 cell once fully assembled
and stacked. This is a stacked board design but in theory, all the hardware should
be able to fit onto one board but is separated to two boards.

## Useful Information
- IMU: BMI160 Module
- ESP32-C3 main processor
